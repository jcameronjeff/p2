## Description 

Accordions allow a user to show or hide sections of related content or functionality on a page. The header may contain an interactive label and icon that expands or collapses content below. The expandable container ensures that the entire content within the accordion is clickable . 

## Usage 

### Labels 

Labels should describe the hidden content and be as short as possible to avoid wrapping or truncation. 

## Patterns  

The following [design patterns](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/design-patterns/) will use the accordion component. 
**Note: patterns are still to come**

### Filter Accordion 

The filter accordion is used to nest filter controls. It has an optional clear function to the right of the label that allows a user to clear all associated selections whether it is expanded or collapsed. If there are no selections, the clear function is hidden. 

The height of the content panel below an expanded filter accordion can be specified as needed and supports internal scrolling if needed.  

Expanding a filter accordion does not change the state of other filter accordions in the same group.

### Menu Accordion 

The menu accordion is used to nest navigation links (e.g., a site menu on mobile), or sections of related content. It can have an optional left icon. If used, every menu accordion in the group must have an icon. 

The height of the content panel below an expanded menu accordion is determined by the height of its content and padding; internal scrolling of the content panel is not supported. 

The menu accordion can be configured to collapse other accordions in the same group when it is expanded.
