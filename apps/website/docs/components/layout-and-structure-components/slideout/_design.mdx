## Description 

Slideouts allow a user to show and hide complex content related to the main screen. As the name implies, the slideout slides in and overlays the main screen until the user dismisses it. 

The slideout consists of an overlay (with its own color and opacity) and a content area. The content area width is determined by the designer according to the needs of the content in the slideout. 

The content area of the slideout completely covers the main screen at the XS breakpoint.

## Usage 

### Content 

Slideouts always have a heading, a close function, and designed content. They normally also have submit/cancel [buttons](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/action-components/button/). 

Use a slideout for complex content (e.g., forms, filters, content details, or navigation menus) which is only needed occasionally at the userâ€™s request. Shorter, less complex content can be handled by a [modal](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/layout-and-structure-components/modal). 

### Interaction 

The slideout prevents the user from interacting with the main screen. All interactivity on the main screen is disabled including scrolling. Users may close a slideout by selecting the overlay of the main screen, the close button, cancel button, or keyboard ESC. 

### Locked Buttons 

If the content of the slideout is taller than the viewport height, submit/cancel buttons (if any) should be fixed to the bottom of the viewable content area.

### Width 

Designers may define the width of the content area as needed by the content layout. Designers should also consider the XS breakpoint, since the slideout content area completely covers the main screen at this breakpoint. 

## Best Practices
### When to use
- You need to show (or gather) complex information in context
- You need to keep users at their current place within the site
- You don't require users to reference information that would be obscured behind the overlay

### Content
- Show tables, forms, and similarly complex entities
