# Chip

> Chips are small elements which present small amounts of information or offer optional actions.

## Common Characteristics

All chips have a background color, and are 24px high. They have 8px left and right padding unless this is increased to achieve a 40px minimum width.

Chips labels may be bold ALL-CAPS, or regular sentence case. Maintain a minimum of 4px space between chips vertically and horizontally.
