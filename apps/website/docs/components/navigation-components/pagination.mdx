## Usage

The Pagination Component is a set of controls that gives a user the ability to navigate a large set of items when they can't be displayed on a single page.

### Common Characteristics

The pagination component only appears at the bottom of a long list of items. (e.g. a search results page, or runlist). It is horizontally centered with the list column, not the whole page.

The pagination control appears the same at every breakpoint and allows the user to navigate to the first page, a previous page, and a next page. The user also has access to a limited set of numbered pages.

```jsx live
<Pagination currentPage={5} totalPages={20} />
```

### Usage Guidelines

Hide the pagination control when there is only one page of list items (governed by the results per page setting).

Display the pagination component only at the bottom of a list of items. It should be centered with the listings, not the page width.

## Code

```jsx live
<Pagination
  currentPage={6}
  totalPages={20}
  onChange={(pageData)=> { console.log(pageData)  }}
/>
```

_The props `currentPage` and `totalPages` are required by the component._

Providing a callback to the `onChange` property will allow the application
author to see the previously selected index and the newly selected index,
identified as `prevIndex` and `index` respectively.
