# STEPPER 

## Description 

The stepper illustrates a user's progress through a linear process and optionally, provides secondary navigation through the process. It provides the user with answers to these process questions: How many steps? Where am I now? What's next? and What is already complete? 

The stepper may be a minimum of two and a maximum of seven steps. Designers should aim for as few steps as necessary in a logical process. 

## Usage 

### Layout 

The stepper is always placed above its relevant content and spans the same width. 

On the M-XXL breakpoints a label is displayed for each step. Step labels are allowed to wrap as needed. 

On the XS-S breakpoints only the label for the current step is displayed. The label may wrap as needed. 

### Interaction 

The stepper is interactive by default but can also be a non-interactive display of the status of a process. 

#### Interactive 

Use an interactive stepper to help guide a user through a linear process. Buttons are always used to navigate through the process. An optional secondary navigation method can be provided for the user by making any completed step selectable. This allows a user to return directly to that step to review and make changes. 

Steps do not have a hover state other than changing the cursor to a pointer. 

#### Non-Interactive 

Use a non-interactive stepper to visually display that a process is currently at a specific step. This helps the user understand which steps are complete and incomplete. 

The stepper also becomes non-interactive when a process is completed and information from the process is submitted. This provides confirmation that the process was completed successfully. 

### Buttons 

To maintain a bias toward forward progress, the forward button should be higher hierarchically than the back button. Designers may also wish to reserve the primary button for the final, completion step.

## Best Practices 

Steppers should always provide a clear indication of progress. 

### Content 

- **Keep the steps clear and concise**: Steps should be easy to understand with clear labels that are simple and straightforward
- **Use clear and visible error messages**: If errors occur, users should be able to clearly understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
