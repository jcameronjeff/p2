# Menu (Dropdown)

>Menus offer an easy way to build custom, accessible dropdown components with robust support for keyboard navigation.

## Basic Example

Menu Buttons are built on top of [HeadlessUI's `Menu`](https://headlessui.dev/react/menu), `Menu.Button`, `Menu.Items`, and `Menu.Item` components.

## Usage Guidelines
Use Action Menus to reduce clutter at the top of a page. Avoid more than two page-level actions.

Use Action Menus to reduce clutter on cards.

Actions that also indicate a status (e.g. Add to workbook or Set Lane Alert) should not be nested in a menu.


## Showing/hiding the menu

By default, your Menu.Items instance will be shown/hidden automatically based on the internal open state tracked within the Menu component itself. [See more](https://headlessui.com/react/menu#showing-hiding-the-menu)



## Closing menus manually

The menu will already close by default, however it can happen that 3rd party Link components use event.preventDefault(), which prevents the default behaviour and therefore won't close the menu. [See more](https://headlessui.dev/react/menu#closing-menus-manually)

  <Story id='components-menu--toolbar' />
</Canvas>

## Disabling an item

Use the disabled prop to disable a Menu.Item. This will make it unselectable via keyboard navigation, and it will be skipped when pressing the up/down arrows. [See more](https://headlessui.dev/react/menu#disabling-an-item)

## Transitions

Menu is pre-configured with our recommended transition animations. These can be customized or replaced All you need to do is wrap the Menu.Items in a `<Transition>`, and the transition will be applied automatically. [See more](https://headlessui.com/react/menu#transitions)
