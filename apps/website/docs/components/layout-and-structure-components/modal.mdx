## Description 

Modals are interrupters which are intended to focus a user’s attention on information and required actions. They overlay the main screen to provide urgent information, or ask for information, or ask for a decision without navigating away from the main screen, thus keeping the user's current context. They must be acted upon or dismissed before a user can continue working on the main screen. 

Modals always include at least one action.

## Sizes 

### Small 

The small modal is 90% of viewport width up to 320px maximum.  It has an optional H4 heading. Styling is the same for all breakpoints. 

### Large 

The large modal is 90% of the viewport width up to 640px maximum, and up to 80% of viewport height. It has a required H3 heading and a “close” icon button. At the XS breakpoint the large modal is restyled as a full screen overlay.

## Usage 

### When to Use 

Since modals are disruptive and can annoy users, they should be used sparingly and kept as brief as possible. They should be user initiated unless an urgent system message needs to be seen and acknowledged. 

Use the small modal for very simple acknowledgements (e.g., “Okay”) or confirmations (e.g., “Okay” / “Cancel”). 

Use the large modal for longer content or very short forms such as an address entry form. 

For very long content, long forms, or multi-step processes, use a [slideout](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/layout-and-structure-components/slideout/) instead.

### Button Labels 

For “okay”/”cancel” scenarios, the submit button label should reflect the action being taken (e.g., “Delete”, “Save Changes”) rather than the generic “okay”. 

### Interaction 

A modal prevents the user from interacting with the main screen. All interactivity on the main screen is disabled including scrolling. Users may close a modal by selecting the main window, a close button, submit/cancel buttons, or keyboard ESC. 

Scrolling content should be avoided in modals. A [slideout](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/layout-and-structure-components/slideout/) is preferred for scrolling content. 

### Locked Buttons 

At the XS breakpoint, the large modal content area completely covers the main screen. If the large modal content on XS is taller than the viewport height, submit/cancel buttons should be locked to the bottom of the viewable content area.

## Best Practices
The purpose of a modal is to focus attention. Since modals appear within an active tab, it ensures visibility by the user. As modals are disruptive by design, they should be used intentionally and infrequently. 
## Content
Modals should help users quickly understand why the modal is displayed. As such, the texxt should be as brief and clear as possible. All modals should include:
- Title text which states the intention of the modal
- Clear indication of the action required to close the modal
