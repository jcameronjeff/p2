### Usage Guidelines

To promote ease of scanning and understanding, follow these UX best practices:

```example
<StopLightList
    green={[
        'Use icons to communicate meaning or emphasize meaning.',
        'Use icons to mean the same thing that they mean in other Manheim applications.',
        'Use text with icons whenever possible.',
        'Use stand alone icons sparingly and specify the alt-text that communicates the meaning of the icon.',
        'Icons with inline text are typically 12px, 14px, or 16px.',
        'Large stand alone icons should be sized in multiples of 8 (e.g. 24px, 32px, 40px, etc).',
        'Provide proportional white space around large standalone icons, also in multiples of 8.',
    ]}
    red={[
        'Use icons as visual enhancements without meaning. Instead, use textures, illustrations, etc as visual enhancements when appropriate.',
        'Use icons to mean something different than their common meaning at Manheim.',
        'Use different icons to mean the same thing.',
        'Use so small an icon that it becomes illegible.',
        'Use so large an icon that it crowds out proportional whitespace.',
    ]}
/>
```

## Code

## Icon Methods

**Icons are installed as a CSS font, and can be applied to self-closing `span` or `i` tags without children.**

```jsx live
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <span className="icon prism-icon-paint-can" />
</div>
```

```jsx live
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <i className="icon prism-icon-checkmark-circle" />
</div>
```
_Icons can be added to the DOM with classnames_

**Or Icons can be rendered as a React component**

```jsx live
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <Icon glyph="360-exterior" color="dark" />
</div>
```
_Icons can also be added to the DOM via the Icon component_

**Or Icons can be rendered as SVGs in the DOM**

```jsx live
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <IconSvg glyph="360-exterior" color="dark" />
</div>
```
_Icons can also be added to the DOM as an SVG via the IconSvg component_


## Color, Size

Icons can be styled with text utility classes.

```jsx live
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <i className="icon prism-icon-checkmark-circle text-success display-4" />
  <Icon glyph="checkmark-circle" color="success" className="display-4 mx-3" />
  <IconSvg glyph="checkmark-circle" color="success" height="35px" />
</div>
```
