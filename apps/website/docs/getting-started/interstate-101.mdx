## What is Interstate?
Interstate is the design system we apply to create a best-in-class experience for Cox Automotive retail and wholesale solutions. Comprised of principles, standards, patterns, and components, Interstate allows us to deliver the One Cox Automotive experience dealers need, and creates a platform to elevate novel components, patterns, guidelines, and approaches for broader use.  

With Interstate, we can broaden the impact of department- and product-level creativity and apply it across the enterprise to achieve our goal of improving the user experience. 

## Who is Interstate for? 

Interstate has 3 core audiences: 

1. Clients (Dealers, OEM Reps, Truckers, Dispatchers, etc) and Team members) 
2. Designers 
3. Developers 

## Why Interstate? 

1. To make it more efficient for our customers to work through their day-to-day experiences by streamlining how users navigate through all of our products
2. To share standards and patterns collectively so we don't re-invent the wheel but instead can efficiently focus our efforts 
3. To empower creativity by helping UX design spend less time on repeatable surface-level UI details, offering more time to focus on structural decisions and explore fundamentally different alternatives 
4. To enable innovation by enabling the development of new and improved products to go to market faster 
5. To reduce front end development churn and costs with pre-defined solutions, enabling a composable user experience
