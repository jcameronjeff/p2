## Description

Radio buttons allow a user to select one item from a short list of two to four options. They are used when the list of options are mutually exclusive and the user must select exactly one choice. 

To select a single item from a list of five or more options, use a [dropdown](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/selection-and-input-components/dropdown) or [combobox](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/selection-and-input-components/combobox)instead. 

The user may interact with the radio button itself or its associated label. The label is vertically centered with the radio button even when the text wraps.  
## Usage 

### Layout 

Allow 32px minimum horizontal space, or 8px minimum vertical space between radio buttons. 

Avoid radio buttons on small screens and use [toggle chips](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/notification-components/chip) or a [toggle group](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/action-components/button-group) instead. 

Avoid nesting radio buttons.

### Filter Counts 

When using radio buttons as filters with counts, display counts on a badge and right align the badges.

### Best Practices 

- **Structure options in a logical order** The list of selections should be structured, whenever possible, in a logical order, such as smallest to largest.
- **Make selection options comprehensive** Avoid vague or misleading labels but include all the necessary information the user needs to make a decision about the selection. 
- **Options should be clearly distinct from one another** Provide clear and distinct choices that are easy to understand. 
- **Always offer a default selection** Radio buttons should always have exactly one option pre-selected. Select the safest and most secure option (to prevent data loss). 
- **Offer “None” as an option where applicable** Permit users to skip making a selection where it is not otherwise required with a choice labeled as "none."
