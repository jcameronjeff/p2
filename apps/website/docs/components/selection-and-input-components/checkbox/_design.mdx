## Description 

Checkboxes are used when there are lists of options and the user may select any number of choices, including zero, one, or several. This allows a user to select one or more items from a list of options or select preferred settings with a single checkbox.  

Default selections can be set by an application as needed. 

Checkboxes allow the user to interact with the checkbox or associated label. The label is vertically centered with the checkbox even when the text wraps. 

## Usage
### Layout 

Allow 32px minimum horizontal space, or 8px minimum vertical space between checkboxes. 

When stacking checkboxes in unusually long lists such as left rail filters, combine checkboxes with a multi-select filter to help users more easily find desired options. 

**Lay out your lists vertically** 

Try to present your lists vertically, with one choice per line. This rule works both for toggles and checkboxes. If you must lay your options in a horizontal layout with multiple options per line, make sure to space the buttons and ensure that labels connected which choices.

### Nesting 

In nested layouts or tables with multiselect, selecting a parent checkbox selects all its children. If child checkboxes are both checked and unchecked, the parent checkbox is indeterminate.

### Filter Counts 

When using checkboxes as filters with counts, display counts on a badge and right align the badges.

### Best Practices 

Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels, so that it's clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. Likewise, avoid negations such as "Don't send me an email," which would mean the user would have to make a selection in order for something not to happen. 

Write checkbox labels so that users know both what will happen if they check a particular box, and what will happen if they leave it unchecked. 

## Code
### Default Uncontrolled Checkbox

The Checkbox component is now uncontrolled. It will take a checked prop, but is rendered as defaultChecked.

```jsx dead
<Checkbox checked={true} id="check1" label="Default" />
```

### Default Controlled Checkbox

```jsx dead
function ControlledCheckbox() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Checkbox.Controlled
      onClick={() => setChecked(!checked)}
      onChange={e => console.log(e)}
      checked={checked}
      id="check2"
      label="Default"
    />
  );
}
```

### Disabled Checkbox

```jsx dead
<Checkbox disabled id="check3" label="Disabled" />
```

### Indeterminate Checkbox

```jsx dead
<Checkbox id="check4" label="Indeterminate" className="indeterminate" />
```
