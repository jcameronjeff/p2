### Usage Guidelines

To promote ease of scanning and understanding, follow these UX best practices:

<StopLightList
  green={[
    'Use icons to communicate meaning or emphasize meaning.',
    'Use icons to mean the same thing that they mean in other Manheim applications.',
    'Use text with icons whenever possible.',
    'Use stand alone icons sparingly and specify the alt-text that communicates the meaning of the icon.',
    'Icons with inline text are typically 12px, 14px, or 16px.',
    'Large stand alone icons should be sized in multiples of 8 (e.g. 24px, 32px, 40px, etc).',
    'Provide proportional white space around large standalone icons, also in multiples of 8.',
  ]}
  red={[
    'Use icons as visual enhancements without meaning. Instead, use textures, illustrations, etc as visual enhancements when appropriate.',
    'Use icons to mean something different than their common meaning at Manheim.',
    'Use different icons to mean the same thing.',
    'Use so small an icon that it becomes illegible.',
    'Use so large an icon that it crowds out proportional whitespace.',
  ]}
/>

## Code

## Icon Methods

**Icons can be applied by including the SVG in the file directly via `import` or the `require()` function.**

```js
const eyeIcon = require('@prism2/icons/eye.svg');
```

**Or Icons can be rendered as a React component**

```jsx
import { UsersIcon } from '@prism2/icons-react/interstate';

function renderIcon() {
  return <UsersIcon />;
}
```

_Icons can also be added to the DOM via the icons-react package_

## Color, Size

Icons can be styled with utility classes.

```jsx
<CheckmarkIcon className='self-center flex-none inline h-6 mr-2 text-green-500' />
```
