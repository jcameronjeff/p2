# Slider

Slider extends the functionality of a normal `input[type='range']` HTML element and will support all valid attributes. It can be used as controlled or uncontrolled component and includes broad accessibility support.

<Primary />

### Inverted

Passing the `inverted` prop will cause the slider to reverse its segment coloring. This is entirely visual and has no effect on data.

<Story of={SliderStories.GreaterThan} />


### Controlled

In this example, we are using `Slider` as a controlled component. This allows us to dynamically adjust the second slider.

<Story of={SliderStories.Controlled} />



### Ranges

Bounded ranges are as simple as adding a second controlled `Slider` components. We make use of the `onChange` `value` and `isHigherValue` props to keep everything aligned. All calculations are done using refs and have no dependency on state.


<Story of={SliderStories.RangeWithin} />
<Story of={SliderStories.RangeOutside} />


### Embelishments

Several decorations can be enabled by passing props for `label` (string or node), `showValues` (boolean), `ticks` (number) . See the table below for details

#### Display Labels

<Story of={SliderStories.Labelled} />

#### Display Values

<Story of={SliderStories.ShowValues} />


#### Display Tickmarks

<Story of={SliderStories.ShowTicks} />


### Disabled State

As with any input, slider can be disabled.

<Story of={SliderStories.Disabled} />
