## Voice and Tone

Our voice is what we say, and our tone is how we say it. 
Together, voice and tone convey our brand &mdash; who we are as a company.

Manheim's voice and tone is bold, determined, and genuine. 
Think of Manheim as co-worker you can depend on, friendly and dependable. 
Write content that is direct, not salesy or overly formal. 
It should sound conversational when you read it out loud.

## Copywriting

-	Be brief and clear.
-	Be accurate. It is more important to be accurate than compelling.
-	Address users as you, and refer to Manheim or COX Automotive as we.
-	Avoid long or complex words and jargon.
-	Break up long blocks of text with informative headings.
-	Use bulleted or numbered lists instead of paragraphs when possible.
-	Use active voice (The dealer bid on the car.), not passive voice (The car was bid on by the dealer.)
-	Aim for a fourth-grade reading level as measured by the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Scale.
-	Use second person (you, your) when addressing users, and first person (we) when referring to Manheim or Cox Automotive.
-	Only use one space after sentences, with single spacing for paragraphs, and no spacing between bulleted or numbered lists.

<a name="content-guidelines__grammar"></a>

## Grammar

-	_Abbreviations and Acronyms_ - If the reader may not recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell out the first reference. Further references do not need parenthesis.
-	_Brands_ - Observe the trademark conventions (including &reg;, &trade;) found on a brand's official website.
-	_Capitalization_ - Do not use all caps except for acronyms, labels, or calls-to-action.
-	_Contractions_ - Use contractions when a message is positive (You're the winning bidder.), and avoid them when it is negative (We apologize, but you can not bid right now.).
-	_Compound Words_ - Use hyphenation when a modifying adjective precedes a noun (e.g. used-vehicle market).

<a name="content-guidelines__punctuation"></a>

## Punctuation

-	_Apostrophe_ - Use in contractions or to indicate possession (Dave's car), not to indicate multiples of something (CRs or the 1980s)
-	_Ampersand_ (&amp;) - Do not use unless part of a brand or product name.
-	_Asterisk_ (&#42;) - Use in-context to denote an annotation at the bottom of page.
-	_Colon_ - Use in body text to introduce a list.
-	_Comma_ - Use to separate items in a list, but do not use the Oxford comma. (e.g. I bought milk, eggs, chicken and bread.)
-	_Exclamation Points_ - Do not use unless part of a brand name.

<a name="content-guidelines__calls-to-action"></a>

## Calls-to-Action (CTAs)

-	Use a descriptive verb/noun label (e.g. Start Claim, Open Workbook, Make an Offer).
-	Do not use generic CTA labels like “Click Here” or “Go”.
-	CTAs should be 2-5 words. Aim for clarity and brevity.
-	See the Manheim Content Style Guide for a list of common CTA verbs and when they are used.
