# Card

Cards provided a visible, unifying container for content and related actions.

Cards are flexible. They can contain text, media, dynamic data, design elements, UI controls, or actions. Cards are usually interactive and may contain multiple related actions.

## Common Characteristics

All cards have a rectangular container with a solid background and 4px rounded corners. The minimum height and width is 80px x 80px.

Cards may be any height and width needed (subject to minimums), and any aspect ratio needed.

## Flexible Content

Cards are intentionally flexible to allow designers to display content as needed. Cards may include headings, text, dynamic data, interactive elements, and other PRISM components.

## Default Example

<Primary />

<Controls />
