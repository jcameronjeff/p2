Our users access our products and tools via an ever-increasing variety of devices—large and small, tap and click and speak. 
So, our products must meet our users’ needs on any device they prefer.

<!--We can't just build products for “mobile” or “desktop”. We must account for a multi-device continuum.-->

## Our Responsive Design Philosophy

Interstate's responsive design philosophy is that we should strive to support the optimal user experience the user's device can deliver from a single code base whenever possible.

## Guiding Principles

This philosophy can be realized by following these guiding principles:

### Fast First

_:NEEDS REVISION: consider a non-Manheim example?_
Our users may only have seconds to obtain and act on a key piece of information (e.g. vehicle sale event). 
The experience should load fast and be easy to learn.

### Seamless Experience

-	Our users expect the same data, content, and features on all their devices.
-	Users should be able to complete _any_ task from any device they choose.
-	User should be able to start working on one device and finish on another.
-	Interactions and controls should vary as needed to deliver a seamless experience that meets usability standards.

### Device-Optimized

-	Enhance the seamless experience by taking advantage of input options (gestures, voice) and device hardware/sensors (camera, GPS, accelerometer, haptic feedback, Bluetooth, bio-metrics, etc).
-	Provide usable, touch-friendly alternative selection controls for small screens.

### Task-Focused

-	Anticipate and adapt to our users' device preferences for key tasks. For example, on small screens our users access VIN scanning and valuations more often than Run Lists.

## Responsive Design in Practice

The best practice for implementing responsive design is to consider small screens first. Small screens force us to prioritize features, content and data to deliver an optimal small screen experience. This experience can then be designed-up for optimal delivery on larger screens.
