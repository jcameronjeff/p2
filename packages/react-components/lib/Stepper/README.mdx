# Stepper

> Easily create accessible, fully customizable step interfaces. (Functionality is provided by [@headlessui/react](https://headlessui.com/react/tabs))

```tsx
import { Step } from '@prism2/react-components'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Step.Group>
      <Step.List>
        <Step>One</Step>
        <Step>Two</Step>
        <Step>Three</Step>
      </Step.List>
      <Step.Panels>
        <Step.Panel>Step One</Step.Panel>
        <Step.Panel>Step Two</Step.Panel>
        <Step.Panel>Step Three</Step.Panel>
      </Step.Panels>
    </Step.Group>
  );
};
```

### Basic

<Primary />

### Including tab content

<Story of={StepperStories.WithPanels} />

### Setting the initial tab

You can force the Stepper to initialize with a specific step pre-selected via the `defaultIndex` prop.

<Story of={StepperStories.InitialStep} />


### Controlling Progress

Out of the box, Stepper manages it's own state. However, you can control the state by passing arguments for the `selectedIndex` and `onChange` props of `Step.Group`. This is useful for controlling the stepper from external elements.

### Manual Mode

Because `Stepper` is based on HeadlessUI, it enjoys full keyboard support. Users can move forward and back through the steps using the `left` and `right` arrow keys. In some cases, you may want to limit the user's ability to navigate steps. When `manual` is enabled, all keyboard interactions are disabled.
