## Packages

### `@interstate/styles`

CSS files are built from the contents of the `@interstate/scss` package and made
avialable within the `@interstate/styles` package. The assets are created using the
following schema:

Root assets match:<br />
`<theme>[-grid|-reboot][.comps][.sandbox][.min].css`

Theme assets match:<br />
`<theme>/<component>[.sandbox][.min].css`

- **`<theme>`**: the theme represented in the file
- **`<component>`**: component styles are specific to
- **[-grid|-reboot]**: _(optional)_ Bootstrap provides three root files: `bootstrap.scss`,
    `bootstrap-grid`, and `bootstrap-reboot`. These files are represented here
    using logic from Bootstrap.
- **[.comps]**: _(optional)_ includes _all_ component styles
- **[.sandbox]**: _(optional)_ prefixes _all_ selectors with `.interstate-sandbox`; this prevents
    Interstate defined styles from "leaking" outside of the container. Developers
    must wrap all Interstate components with this class name in order to have the
    Interstate styles appear.
- **[.min]**: _(optional)_ minified file using CSSNano

Themes available now:

- `interstate`: this is the "Manheim" theme; the name is scheduled to change to
  `"manheim"` in the future
- `mui`: _(deprecated)_ a theme to carry over MUI styles to make ease transitions


### `@interstate/scss`

This package consists of raw scss files used within the Interstate library to build
the `@interstate/styles` package. The `@interstate/scss` package can be useful to build
app specific components that will match the Interstate design system as it changes
over time.

As of version `1.10.0`, work is being done to extend Bootstrap in a more cohesive manner
enabling more updates and code to be leveraged from the Bootstrap ecosystem.
This work will impact the `@interstate/scss` package over time.

## Usage

### Bootstrap

Branding and style guidelines are provided by the user experience group once
approved. The approval process has many layers and currently results in a
specification established in Figma for usage, design, and content. In
development, styling is heavily based off Bootstrap and Interstate extends it under
the hood.

This means, the class names provided by Bootstrap are likely available to be
used in your applications including the utility classes such as
[spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/utilities/spacing/) and
[text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/utilities/text/). Some Bootstrap class
names have also been made into modules such as `@interstate/container`, `@interstate/row`,
and `@interstate/col` for the [Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/).

If you find a class name does not appear to be supported for some reason in the
Interstate library, please [file an issue](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/Interstate/interstate/issues/new/choose)
(for faster corrections also provide a [pull request](https://ghe.coxautoinc.com/Interstate/interstate/compare)).

### Z Index

_:NEEDS REVISION: Does this need to be on a different page?_

When working with the ordering of different layers, keeping track of each
individual position can be taxing. Below is a list of starting indexes based on
the role of the component. Ranges are incremented in thousands to allow plenty
of room for the number of things applications can hold.

Note, this list is different from the
[z-index](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/overview/#z-index) variables Bootstrap
provides. These variables are fine to use within the application as they will
fall well below the ranges defined. The ranges defined here are standardized and
used across several applications and shared services and influence the
components built within the Interstate library. Stacking conflicts can likely be
avoided by adhering to these ranges as well.

| Classification | Starting
|----------------|-----------
| interstitial | 11001
| mask--interstitial | 11000
| dialog | 10001
| mask--dialog | 10000
| overlay | 9001
| mask--overlay | 9000
| header | 8000
| reserved | 7000
| inline-loading | 6000
| ads | 5000


### Themes

As of version `1.10.0`, Interstate has one theme known as the "Manheim" theme. This
is the current face of Interstate. Other themes are in development to support other
brands and usage requirements. Themes are built and published through the
`@interstate/styles` package. This package, contains built `.css` files useful to style
components within an application. Component sytles are both bundled and separated
within the theme directories published.
