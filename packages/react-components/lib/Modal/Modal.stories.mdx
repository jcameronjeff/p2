# Modal

> A fully-managed dialog component jam-packed with accessibility and keyboard features, perfect for building completely custom modal and dialog windows or using as a preset.

Modals are child windows which appear in front of the main window to provide urgent information, or ask for information, or ask for a decision while keeping the user's current context. Modals demand a user's attention and must be acted upon or dismissed before a user can continue working in the main window.

Modals are disruptive and can annoy users. Therefore, they should be used sparingly and kept brief, without multiple steps. They should be user initiated unless an urgent system message needs to be seen and acknowledged.

## Basic Example

<Canvas>
  <Story id='components-modal--basic-example' />
</Canvas>

Modals are built on top of [HeadlessUI's `Dialog`](https://headlessui.dev/react/dialog), `Dialog.Overlay`, `Dialog.Title` and `Dialog.Description` components.


## Slideout Variant

The `<SlideOut />` component has been deprecated in favor of `<Modal variant='slideout' {...etc} />`. This allows us to keep a minimal API surface area while allowing apps to freely transition between experiences.

## Usage Guidelines

Modals are disruptors which are known to annoy users in many cases, so use them sparingly. Only use modals for brief processes when maintaining the user's current context is important. For long processes with multiple steps or options, consider a new page or full-page overlay.The optimal use cases for modals are:

Modals should only include one or two actions. If one, it must be an acknowledgement action (e.g. “OK”). If two, one must be a confirming action, and the other a dismissing action. (e.g. “SUBMIT” and “CANCEL”).

## Showing and hiding your modal

When the dialog's `open` prop is `true`, the contents of the dialog will render. Focus will be moved inside the dialog and trapped there as the user cycles through the focusable elements. Scroll is locked, the rest of your application UI is hidden from screen readers, and clicking outside the dialog or pressing the Escape key will call the `onClose` function and close the dialog.

Modals have no automatic management of their open/closed state. To show and hide your dialog, pass React state into the `open` prop. When `open` is true the dialog will render, and when it's false the dialog will unmount.

The `onClose` callback fires when an open dialog is dismissed, which happens when the user clicks outside the your `Dialog.Panel` or presses the Escape key. You can use this callback to set open back to false and close your dialog.

## Managing Focus

For accessibility reasons, your modal should contain at least one focusable element. By default, the `Modal` component will focus the first focusable element (by DOM order) once it is rendered, and pressing the Tab key will cycle through all additional focusable elements within the contents.

Focus is trapped within the modal as long as it is rendered, so tabbing to the end will start cycling back through the beginning again. All other application elements outside of the modal will be marked as inert and thus not focusable.

If you'd like something other than the first focusable element to receive initial focus when your modal is initially rendered, you can use the initialFocus ref:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const firstFocusRef = useRef(null);
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
    <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
    <Modal initialFocus={firstFocusRef} {...props}>
      <Dialog.Title>My Modal Title</Dialog.Title>
      <p>
        The OK button is focused. You can close this dialog by hitting enter.
      </p>
      <button ref={firstFocusRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>Ok!</button>
    </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Using the Title and Description components

For accessibility reasons, you should use the `Dialog.Title` and `Dialog.Description` components when rendering content that labels and describes your dialog contents. They will be automatically linked to the root `Modal` component via the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes, and their contents will be announced to users using screenreaders.

## Scrollable dialogs

Making a dialog scrollable is handled entirely in CSS, and the specific implementation depends on the design you are trying to achieve. [See more](https://headlessui.dev/react/dialog#scrollable-dialogs)


## Rendering to a portal

If you've ever implemented a Dialog before, you've probably come across [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) in React. Portals let you invoke components from one place in the DOM (for instance deep within your application UI), but actually render to another place in the DOM entirely.

Since Dialogs and their backdrops take up the full page, you typically want to render them as a sibling to the root-most node of your React application. That way you can rely on natural DOM ordering to ensure that their content is rendered on top of your existing application UI. This also makes it easy to apply scroll locking to the rest of your application, as well as ensure that your Dialog's contents and backdrop are unobstructed to receive focus and click events.

Because of these accessibility concerns, Headless UI's `Dialog` component actually uses a Portal under-the-hood. This way we can provide features like unobstructed event handling and making the rest of your application inert. So, when using our Dialog, there's no need to use a Portal yourself! We've already taken care of it.

## Transitions

Modal is pre-configured with our recommended transition animations. These can be customized or replaced with the `outerTransition` and `innerTransition` props. These are objects that accept all of the same arguments as `Transition` [See more](https://headlessui.dev/react/dialog#transitions)

### Named Transition Presets

> This is a draft proposal specification.

| Transition | Description | Duration | Easing |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- |
| **fadeInOut** | Basic fade-in and fade-out transitions, opacity only. | 200ms | linear |
| **slideUpDown** | Children appear from the bottom with a slight scaling effect | 200ms | ease-in-out |
| **slideInRight** | Children slide in from the right edge of the viewport | 200ms | ease-in-out |
| **slideInLeft** | Children slide in from the left edge of the viewport | 200ms | ease-in-out |

### Transition arguments

- **enter**: Applied the entire time an element is entering. Usually you define your duration and what properties you want to transition here, for example transition-opacity duration-75.
- **enterFrom**: The starting point to enter from, for example opacity-0 if something should fade in.
- **enterTo**: The ending point to enter to, for example opacity-100 after fading in.
- **leave**: Applied the entire time an element is leaving. Usually you define your duration and what properties you want to transition here, for example transition-opacity duration-75.
- **leaveFrom**: The starting point to leave from, for example opacity-100 if something should fade out.
- **leaveTo**: The ending point to leave to, for example opacity-0 after fading out.

### Composing Transitions

You can customize the behavior of a transition preset by merging it with your own arguments.

```jsx
let myTransition = {
  // apply the `slideUpDown` preset
  ...slideUpDown,
  // inject our own `enter` argument
  enter: 'transition ease-linear duration-100'
}
return <Transition outerTransition={myTransition}>{/* ... */}</Transition>
```

## HTML-only using classnames

You may want to use the unmodified `Dialog` component for maximum customization. However, this means you will need to apply styling with classnames manually. Below is the barebones structure to target.

```jsx
<div className="prism-dialog-frame">
  <div className='prism-dialog-backdrop'>
    <div className="prism-dialog-overlay" />
    <div className='prism-dialog-box'>
      {/* children */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
