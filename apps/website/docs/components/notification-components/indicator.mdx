Indicators are simple, non-interactive displays of information (e.g., status) in a variety of visual forms.

## Usage 

### Labels 

Indicators with a text label should use no more than one or two words and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. 

### Badge 

Badges are visually similar to chips and can use color to communicate meaning such as status. They may have an optional left or right icon, but not both. 

Maintain a minimum of 4px vertical and horizontal space between badges. 

### Flag 

Flags can indicate status or provide light merchandizing. 

When to use a flag:
- Indicate a new product
- Show a price has dropped
- Indicate something has expired. 
A flag may have an optional left icon. 

Flags can use any brand or status color for the surface. However, the surface color must have good contrast with a black or white text label. 

Only use one or two flags within a parent element (e.g., a card or vehicle listing). 

### Ribbon 

Like flags, ribbons are used to indicate status or provide merchandizing and have the same color options. However, a ribbon does not have an icon, and it can potentially overlay content, such as a vehicle image. 

Only use one ribbon within a parent element.

### Auction Lights 

Auction Lights are a specialty indicator used to digitally replicate live, in-lane auction lights. The digital version uses the same colors to indicate the same meaning as the in-lane version.
