## Usage

<definition>

### Definition

The stepper illustrates a user's progress through a series of steps to complete a process, and optionally, provides secondary navigation through the process. It provides the user with answers to these process questions: How many steps? Where am I now? What's next? and What's complete?

</definition>

The stepper can be interactive, allowing a user to complete a process. In this case, use buttons for primary navigation, and the steps as secondary, direct navigation. A non-interactive stepper simply indicates status of a process.

An interactive stepper is most useful for a 2-7 step process. However, the number of steps should be as few as possible.


### Common Characteristics

Individual steps in all steppers may be complete, valid vs. error, and required vs. optional.


### Interactive Steppers

Interactive steppers should be used with buttons as primary navigation. Use a contained button for forward navigation, and a text or outlined button for backward navigation.

```example
<SandboxDemo>
<InteractiveStepper />
</SandboxDemo>
```

_Interactive stepper with primary and secondary navigation._

### Small Screens

On small screens (XS breakpoint), only the current step label is displayed.

```example
<SandboxDemo>
<InteractiveStepper size="sm" />
</SandboxDemo>
```

_Interactive stepper with primary and secondary navigation._


### Non-interactive Steppers

```example
<SandboxDemo>
<Stepper currentStep={1} size="sm">
  <Step complete>Step 1</Step>
  <Step complete>Step 2</Step>
  <Step>Step 3 Long Label</Step>
</Stepper>
</SandboxDemo>
```

## Design


### States

Individual steps in all steppers may be complete, valid vs error, and required vs. optional. 

### Implementations

## Code

### Sizes

The Stepper comes in two different sizes. The largest of which is the
default and is responsive. Starting at the smallest component size at the
smallest screen width and then adjusting in size as the viewport changes in size.

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={1}>
  <Step complete>Pick Up Location</Step>
  <Step>Confirm</Step>
</Stepper>
```

### Small Size

Occasionally you need to lock a component to the smallest size. This is done
with the `size="sm"` property.

```jsx dead
<Stepper size="sm" currentStep={1}>
  <Step complete>Pick Up Location</Step>
  <Step>Confirm</Step>
</Stepper>
```


### React Notation

The Stepper comes with a Step component available to inject steps with
custom props directly into the Stepper component.

### Minimal

When using the Step component, titles can be included either as a child of the
Step component or as a title prop of the Step component.

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={1}>
  <Step>Pick Up Location</Step>
  <Step>Shipping Address</Step>
  <Step>Delivery Method</Step>
  <Step>Confirm</Step>
</Stepper>
```

### Expanded

This example aims to highlight how you specify which step is complete. By default, all steps are complete if they are before the
currentStep index.

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={2}>
  <Step complete title="Pick Up Location" />
  <Step complete title="Shipping Address" />
  <Step title="Delivery Method" />
  <Step title="Confirm" />
</Stepper>
```


### Object Notation

Depending on the environment, an Array of step titles or objects may be used in
lieu of using a Step component. As all Step components, steps before the
currentStep index will be marked as complete by default.

### Minimal

Titles can be passes as a string or as a title property to the Step
configuration object.

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={2} steps={[
  'Pick Up Location',
  'Shipping Address',
  'Delivery Method',
  'Confirm'
]} />
```


### Expanded

In order to display a Step to specify one as complete, Step
configuration objects will need to be used. These can also be mixed with title
strings for when only one step needs to have complete specified.

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={1} steps={[
  { title: 'Pick Up Location', complete: true },
  { title: 'Shipping Address'},
  'Delivery Method',
  'Confirm'
]} />
```

### Step Locations and Callbacks

Steps can be directed to other locations or actions by providing `href` or
`onClick` properties to the step either when using `React Notation` or
`Object Notation`.

### React Notation

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={1}>
  <Step onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); alert('#Pick-Up-Location'); }}>Pick Up Location</Step>
  <Step href="#nope" title="Shipping Address" />
</Stepper>
```

### Object Notation

```jsx dead
<Stepper currentStep={1} steps={[
  {
    title: 'Pick Up Location',
    onClick: (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('#Pick-Up-Location');
    }
  },
  {
    title: 'Shipping Address',
    href: '#Shipping-Address'
  }
]} />
```

### Stepper Props

| Name               | Type              | Default                   | Description
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------
| currentStep        | `number`          | `1`                       | Sets the currently selected step
| size               | `string`          | `"lg"`                    | Sets size of the tooltip to either sm or lg
