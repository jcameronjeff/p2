## Guidance

The primary action for saving something new should be labeled “Save [Action]”. 
Please work with a Content Designer when questions arise.

The primary action for editing something that already exists should be labeled “Save Changes.”

In the rare case that there is not enough space for these labels, the primary action may be abbreviated to “Save.”

## Rationale

This ensures that all our applications use clear and consistent language for these scenarios.

## Avoid

- Don't use generic terms or technical jargon such as update or submit.
