# Slider

Slider extends the functionality of a normal `input[type='range']` HTML element and will support all valid attributes. It can be used as controlled or uncontrolled component and includes broad accessibility support.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Inverted

Passing the `inverted` prop will cause the slider to reverse its segment coloring. This is entirely visual and has no effect on data.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--greater-than" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

In this example, we are using `Slider` as a controlled component. This allows us to dynamically adjust the second slider.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--controlled" />
</Canvas>


### Ranges

Bounded ranges are as simple as adding a second controlled `Slider` components. We make use of the `onChange` `value` and `isHigherValue` props to keep everything aligned. All calculations are done using refs and have no dependency on state.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--range-within" />
</Canvas>
<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--range-outside" />
</Canvas>

### Embelishments

Several decorations can be enabled by passing props for `label` (string or node), `showValues` (boolean), `ticks` (number) . See the table below for details
#### Display Labels

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--labelled" />

#### Display Values

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--show-values" />
</Canvas>

#### Display Tickmarks

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-slider--show-ticks" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled State

As with any input, slider can be disabled.

  <Story id="components-slider--disabled" />
