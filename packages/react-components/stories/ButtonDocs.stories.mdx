# Button

With `MDX` we can define a story for `Button` right in the middle of our
markdown documentation.

<Canvas>
<Story name="All Buttons">
<form className='flex gap-2'>
  <Button id="Unchecked" label="Unchecked" />
  <Button id="Checked" label="Checked" checked />
  <Button variant="aux" id="second" label="Secondary" />
</form>
</Story>
</Canvas>

# Usage

Buttons allow a user to submit or request information, make decisions, and for navigation.

Button hierarchy is established by whether a button is contained (i.e. with a background color) for most emphasis, or outlined (no background) for less emphasis, or text only for the least emphasis.

Buttons may be normal (40px high) or small (32px). Full-screen width buttons are only allowed on the XS grid (0-479). In all other cases, button width is determined by the length of the label plus minimum L/R padding.


### Common Characteristics

All buttons have bold, ALL-CAPS labels.

All buttons have these states: disabled, active, hover/tap, and focused.

<Story name="Simple Buttons">
<div className='flex gap-2'>
<button className='ring-0 text-xs'>CONTAINED BUTTON</button>
<button className='bg-gold-dark ring-0 text-navy'>CONTAINED BUTTON</button>
</div>
</Story>

### Size

Buttons are normally 40px high, but a small 32px alternative may be used when vertical space is at a premium. Whichever size is used, use the same size for any associated elements like inputs and selects.

Special controls like the keyword search button, pagination controls, icon buttons, and menu buttons are always 32px high.
