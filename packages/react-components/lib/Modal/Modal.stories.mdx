# Modal

A fully-managed, renderless dialog component jam-packed with accessibility and keyboard features, perfect for building completely custom modal and dialog windows for your next application.

Modals are built on top of HeadlessUI's `[Dialog](https://headlessui.dev/react/dialog)`, `Dialog.Overlay`, `Dialog.Title` and `Dialog.Description` components.


## Basic Example

When the dialog's `open` prop is `true`, the contents of the dialog will render. Focus will be moved inside the dialog and trapped there as the user cycles through the focusable elements. Scroll is locked, the rest of your application UI is hidden from screen readers, and clicking outside the dialog or pressing the Escape key will call the `onClose` function and close the dialog.

</Canvas>

## Managing Focus

For accessibility reasons, your modal should contain at least one focusable element. By default, the `Modal` component will focus the first focusable element (by DOM order) once it is rendered, and pressing the Tab key will cycle through all additional focusable elements within the contents.

Focus is trapped within the modal as long as it is rendered, so tabbing to the end will start cycling back through the beginning again. All other application elements outside of the modal will be marked as inert and thus not focusable.

If you'd like something other than the first focusable element to receive initial focus when your modal is initially rendered, you can use the initialFocus ref:

## Using the Title and Description components

For accessibility reasons, you should use the `Dialog.Title` and `Dialog.Description` components when rendering content that labels and describes your dialog contents. They will be automatically linked to the root `Modal` component via the `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` attributes, and their contents will be announced to users using screenreaders.
