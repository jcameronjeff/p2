## Button

## Description

Buttons allow a user to take an action. With a button, a user can submit or request information, make decisions, and navigate.

When choosing the right button for an action, consider the level of emphasis each button type provides

Primary buttons have the most visual emphasis. Secondary buttons have less visual emphasis. Text buttons have the least visual emphasis.

## Sizes

Button sizes are large, medium (default), small, and auxiliary (or extra small).

Button width is determined by a button’s content (icon and/or text) and minimum left/right padding. Designers may adjust buttons to exceed the minimum padding and content width.

Full-width buttons should be reserved for narrow layouts such as for mobile screens or narrow [slideouts](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/layout-and-structure-components/slideout/).

## Usage

### Icons

Buttons with text labels may have an optional left or right icon, but not both. Buttons may also have an [icon](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/images-and-icon-components/icon) without text.

### Hierarchy

Hierarchy gives subtle clues to users about which is the most desirable action. When creating a button system, make sure to match the styles with each button type's importance.

A primary action is an action that allows the user to accomplish their most common or most important goal. As such, primary buttons should only be used for the most important action.

Only one primary button may be used in a containing element. For example, a page without sections may have only one primary button, whereas a page of vehicle listings may have a primary button on each listing.

Not all buttons correspond to a desirable action. While the primary button is used for the action you want a user to take, secondary buttons are for alternatives (such as "Cancel" buttons).

Secondary buttons should still look and feel like buttons but have a more toned-down style.

You can also use secondary buttons or text buttons when two or more actions are needed on a page.

When pairing two buttons for submit/cancel, use a primary button for submit and a text button for cancel. When only one button is needed (such as, “Okay”) use a primary button.

### Scale Alignment

Always match button size with input size: i.e., medium inputs with medium buttons; small inputs with small buttons.

Use Medium (default) buttons in most cases. In dense layouts where vertical space is at a premium, small buttons may be used on large screens.

Small buttons are never used on mobile screens. Large buttons may be an appropriate option for certain applications intended for tablet use in the field.

### Disabling Buttons

In most cases, buttons should not be disabled. Potential exceptions to this may be:

- When a user does not have role permissions to perform an action.
- When a button has been submitted and the request is in progress.
- When it is the most efficient approach to helping the user complete work accurately.

### Layout

Button placement matters when it comes to helping users intuitively know where and how to take an action, especially considering users are experienced in multiple web applications.

In general, but especially in small windows, the primary action button is placed at the bottom right. Our brains naturally scan the content on the screen, making it a common best practice to have the most important actions placed in the bottom right.

Additionally, when it comes to mobile use, the majority of mobile interactions are completed with the thumb and designed for the right-handed majority of the population.

Buttons are normally aligned to the right with the primary action on the far right.

In a multi-step process, a “Back” button may be aligned to the left.

When stacked on a narrow screen, the primary action is placed above the other action.

When content is expected to push buttons below the viewport, they should normally be locked to the bottom of the viewport in a horizontal or stacked configuration. Locked buttons are placed on background with opacity so user has visual understanding of content below.

### Variations

##### Auxiliary Buttons

Auxiliary buttons are very small text buttons with short labels which are useful for infrequent actions (e.g.,“Refresh”), or to provide multiple actions in a tight layout (e.g.,“Details”, “Copy VIN”). They can be used with a left or right [icon](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/images-and-icon-components/icon).

### Floating Action Buttons

Floating Action Buttons are fixed in a specific location and are only displayed when relevant to the displayed content. These buttons overlay content on the screen when they display.

Common examples allow a user to create something new, scroll to the top of a page, or scroll horizontally in a carousel or media viewer.

Floating Action Buttons may be icon only, or text with a left or right icon.

## Best Practices

### Content and Labels

Button labels should always inspire your users to act. That’s why the best buttons use action verbs. When users read action verbs like Save, Download or Edit, they know exactly what the button will do when pressed.

Use simple and concise language in your button labels to clearly describe what action the user takes when they click it.

When they’re moving to the next step: “Continue”

When they’re completing payment: “Complete payment”

When they’re signing up: “Sign Up”

Avoid using terms that are generic and non-specific such as “ok”. Instead use words that relate to the action. One way to do this is to repeat the action verb that is used in the headline of the page or window.

### Accessibility

Users should be able to navigate to and activate a button with assistive tech.

### Styles

_Styles for buttons are coming soon_

## Code

**In regular markup, using the `.btn` class without a modifier will create a contained button. The `.btn` class can be used on `<button>, <a>, or <input>` elements. Links should be assigned a role="button" attribute.**

**With React, the Button component can apply branded styles by padding properties. Theming is available with `color` (string), `size` (string), `variant`(string), `icononly`(bool), and `disabled` (bool).**

### Contained Buttons

Icons can be added before or after text.

```jsx dead
<Container>
  <Row>
    <Col>
      <Row className='row align-items-center'>
        <Button color='primary' className='m-2'>
          CONTAINED BUTTON
        </Button>
        <Button color='primary' className='m-2'>
          <i className='icon btn-icon__left interstate-icon-search' />
          ICON BUTTON
        </Button>
        <Button disabled color='primary' className='m-2'>
          DISABLED BUTTON
        </Button>
        <Button color='primary' className='m-2'>
          ICON BUTTON
          <i className='btn-icon__right icon interstate-icon-chevron-right' />
        </Button>
        <Button color='primary' size='sm' className='m-2'>
          CONTAINED SMALL BUTTON
        </Button>
        <Button color='primary' size='sm' className='btn-icon-only m-2'>
          <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
        </Button>
        <Button
          className='btn-icon-only m-2'
          disabled
          color='primary'
          size='sm'
        >
          <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
        </Button>
        <Button color='simulcast' className='m-2'>
          SIMULCAST BID BUTTON
        </Button>
      </Row>
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Outlined Buttons

For outlined buttons, add a `.btn-outline-***` modifier followed by color.

With React, pass the `outline` value for `variant` prop to the Button component. This will apply required styles, so it is **not necessary to pass a color prop**.

```jsx dead
<Container>
  <Row>
    <Col>
      <Button variant='outline' className='m-2'>
        OUTLINE BUTTON
      </Button>
      <Button variant='outline' className='m-2'>
        <i className='icon btn-icon__left interstate-icon-search' />
        ICON BUTTON
      </Button>
      <Button variant='outline' disabled className='m-2'>
        DISABLED BUTTON
      </Button>
      <Button variant='outline' className='m-2'>
        ICON BUTTON
        <i className='btn-icon__right icon interstate-icon-chevron-right' />
      </Button>
      <Button variant='outline' size='sm' className='m-2'>
        OUTLINE SMALL BUTTON
      </Button>
      <Button className='btn-icon-only m-2' variant='outline' size='sm'>
        <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
      </Button>
      <Button icononly disabled variant='outline' size='sm' className='m-2'>
        <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
      </Button>
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Text Buttons

With React, pass the `textonly` value to `variant` prop to the Button component. This will apply required styles, so it is **not necessary to pass a color prop**.

```jsx dead
<Container>
  <Row>
    <Button variant='textonly' className='m-2'>
      TEXT BUTTON
    </Button>
    <Button variant='textonly' className='m-2'>
      <i className='icon btn-icon__left interstate-icon-search' />
      ICON BUTTON
    </Button>
    <Button disabled variant='textonly' className='m-2'>
      DISABLED BUTTON
    </Button>
    <Button variant='textonly' className='m-2'>
      ICON BUTTON
      <i className='btn-icon__right icon interstate-icon-chevron-right' />
    </Button>
    <Button variant='textonly' size='sm' className='m-2'>
      TEXT SMALL BUTTON
    </Button>
    <Button variant='textonly' icononly className='m-2'>
      <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
    </Button>
    <Button disabled variant='textonly' icononly className='m-2'>
      <i className='icon interstate-icon-envelope' />
    </Button>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Alternative Button styles

#### Auxiliary Button

```jsx dead
<Container>
  <Row>
    <Col>
      <Button variant='aux' className='m-1'>
        Auxiliary Button
      </Button>
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

#### Action Link Button

Action links are text links that appear as an anchor but perform an action rather than direct the browser to a new URL via an `href`.

```jsx dead
<Button variant='actionLink' onClick={() => alert('action link click')}>
  Action Link Button
</Button>
```

### Floating Action Buttons

A contained button may be modified to create a floating action button by using the `floatingAction` value for `variant` prop.
The floatingAction button accepts primary or secondary color styles via the `color` prop. The `textonly` or `outline` values cannot be used in conjunction with the `floatingAction` value for `variant` prop.

**Only one floatingAction button can be used on a single page.**

```jsx dead
<>
  <div>
    The floating action button will overlay content and is locked to a specific
    position in the lower right of the screen.
  </div>
  <Button
    color='primary'
    variant='floatingAction'
    className='m-2'
    onClick={() => alert('This is a floating action button')}
  >
    <i className='icon btn-icon__left interstate-icon-plus' />
  </Button>
</>
```
