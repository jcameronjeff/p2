## Base Token Strategy

### system | global | core | base tokens

- names represent a common name for a specific value
- absolute values are scaled with numbers  (blue.100,200,300 etc)
- relative values are scaled with names (leading-loose, tight, etc.)
- aka "system", "global"

This is already being accomplished with our Tailwind theme. Nearly all CSS properties are defined here. This allows us to facilitate further tokenization freely.

## Reference Tokens
- names represents a purpose or context
- correspond to a repeating style or pattern
- provide simple relational mapping

Reference tokens provide a way to alias/map our system tokens to Reference tokens are where the main theming experience takes place. Typically, these correspond to a "color by number key" -- where we can define which of our *base tokens*

In the example below, we assign `primary` and `on-primary` a base token value - giving us blue text on a white background. Additionally, our system calls for the inverse - with a blue background and white text.

We can define this relationship deterministically with referencing:

```js
// white text on blue background
ref.color.primary = base.color.blue.700
ref.color.on-primary = base.color.white

// white background with blue text
ref.primary-container = ref.color.on-primary
ref.on-primary-container = ref.color.primary

// with cx mappings
ref.cx.secondary-container = ref.color.on-primary
ref.cx.secondary = ref.color.primary
```



## pseudo states

### ui-active:
This corresponds to surfaced that are hovered or focused. It does not include any focus decorations. This state is always determined by the user or a result of user action.
- focus rings are styled separately and determined by the browser.
- Listbox
- Combobox
- RadioGroup
- Menu

### ui-selected
This corresponds to *current* items in a list such in cases where a "checked" Boolean may not satisfy requirements.
- Listbox.Item
- Combobox.Item
- Tab

### ui-checked
- Toggle/Switch
- Radio

### ui-open
A dynamic-only state that corresponds to elements that can be hidden or revealed and their respective toggle. An example is a Menu.Button and Menu.Panel. When the panel is visible - both are considered "open"
- Combobox
- Disclosure
- Menu
- Listbox
