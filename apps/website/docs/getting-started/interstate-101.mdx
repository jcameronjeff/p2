## Design Intent

UX pioneer Jared Spool has described design as <a href="https://articles.uie.com/design_rendering_intent/">the rendering of intent</a>. 
By this, Spool means that a design is a presentation that tries to produce an intended outcome.

_Our intent is to help our users complete their tasks as efficiently as possible._

Interstate is a system of components and patterns that promote efficient work. 
Our aim is to reduce ambiguity, steps, unnecessary work, and rework.

## Guiding Principles

These principles guide design decisions to promote efficient user experiences.
