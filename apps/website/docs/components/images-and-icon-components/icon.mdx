## Description 

Icons are used to communicate and reinforce meaningful actions and content. They may be used with text or without text. They are meaningful, not merely decorative, and have defined meanings in the design system. 

The [icon](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/styles/icons) gallery is available and further defined in [Styles](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/styles/).

## Sizes 

Icons are 16x16px by default. When used with text, icons must be the same size as associated text, e.g., 16px icon with 16px text, 14px with 14px text, etc. 

Large icons without text should be sized in multiples of eight, e.g., 24px, 32px, etc. Proportional blank space around large icons should also be sized in multiples of eight. 

10px and smaller icons should be avoided. As a best practice, Consider the visual complexity of the icon when scaling to sizes smaller than 16px. Complex icons can become illegible at smaller sizes." 

*Hint: In Figma, when resizing icons, you may need to switch from outline to fill if your icons get thinner as they resize.* 

## Usage 

Combine icons with text whenever possible to reinforce the meaning of the icon. In general, only icons that are widely understood should be used alone. For example, a left-pointing chevron could be used alone since it means “back” to most users. If used alone, include the meaning of the icon in the alt-text attribute. 

To promote ease of scanning and understanding, follow these UX best practices: 

### Do 
- Use icons consistently according to their defined meaning
- Use text with icons whenever possible
- Use stand-alone icons only when widely understood and specify the alt-text to communicate the meaning of the icon on hover
- Provide proportional white space around large standalone icons in multiples of 8

### Don’t 
- Use icons as visual enhancements without meaning. Instead, use textures or illustrations as visual enhancements when appropriate
- Use icons to mean something different than their defined meaning in the system
- Use multiple icons to mean the same thing
- Use so small an icon that it becomes illegible
- Use so large an icon that it crowds out proportional whitespace
