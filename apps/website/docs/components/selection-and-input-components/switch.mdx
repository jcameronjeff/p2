# SWITCH 

## Description 

The switch allows a user to toggle a binary function on or off. A switch should produce an immediate change in the surrounding UI to let the user know it is working, and should not be replaced by a [checkbox](https://interstate-staging.awsgdmshednp.manheim.com/docs/components/selection-and-input-components/switch) in a form. 

If an immediate change is not needed (e.g., setting a preference), consider using a single checkbox instead.

## Usage 

### Labels 

The switch label is left-aligned (default) or can be optionally top-aligned.  

The label should describe the option that the switch controls, as well as its state. Keep labels short and direct. A label should describe that the control does when the switch is on.

## Best Practices 

Switches control binary options, not opposing ones. A binary option represents a single state that is either on or off.  

Opposing options are two separate states that are opposite but related to different user tasks

### Labels 

- Use sentence case for button labels 
- Avoid unnecessary punctuation like periods and exclamation points 
- Keep labels short (around 1 to 3 words)
